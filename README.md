# Pomodoro-Eyestrain-Helper-and-Reminder

This code is a timer/reminder for breaks which helps our eyes and mental when studying/working. 
However, Real time isn't coded in this program since the fastest instance of the notification is every 20 mins which is a very long time to wait for
and this is just a prototype of what I imagine this complete program would be so it will be set on seconds and not minutes for efficient testing.
code needs ico/icon files to run. 

Bugs: Gui will not respond after successfully launching Eye rest or Pomodoro but there are no issues in About option (timers work perfectly even if the gui lags)
      Only way to stop the timers is to close the gui or end the task in task manager.
