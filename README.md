# Pomodoro-Eyestrain-Helper-and-Reminder

This code is a timer/reminder for breaks which helps our eyes and mental when studying/working. 
However, Real time isn't coded in this program since the fastest instance of the notification is every 20 mins which is a very long time to wait for
and this is just a prototype of what I imagine this complete program would be so it will be set on seconds and not minutes for efficient testing.
code needs ico/icon files to run. 

This program has peaked my interests because as a person who uses the computer to code, study, work, etc. on many hours per day, I can use this to implement in my study habits
to have a healthier experience and prevent myself from potential fatigue and strains. It also motivates me to take my studying seriously as my breaks are timed which prevents
me from procrastinating and being distracted.

Bugs: Gui will not respond after successfully launching Eye rest or Pomodoro but there are no issues in About option (timers work perfectly even if the gui lags)
      Only way to stop the timers is to close the gui or end the task in task manager.
